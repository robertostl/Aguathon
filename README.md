# Aguathon

Code for our participation in the "I HACKATHON DEL AGUA".

In recent times, due to meteorological changes due to climate change, the number of floods around the Ebro River has been increasing (there was one in 2013, another in 2016, another in 2017 and this last year, another one).

The trend, from having a flood every few years to annual floods, gives rise to the need for a tool, or mathematical algorithm, to help predict possible floods that may occur in the following years.

Taking this data as a basis, the objective of this Hackathon is to model the behaviour of the level of the Ebro River as it passes through the city of Zaragoza in order to obtain realistic predictions of its variation at any given moment.

With these predictions, the Public Administration (emergency systems, etc.) will be able to generate automatic alerts of possible overflows (floods) and activate the emergency and supervision systems to avoid possible damage that may be caused to the citizens of the city of Zaragoza.

This Hackathon will focus, knowing that around 70% of the citizens of Aragon live in Zaragoza, on the city of Zaragoza, but it will be scalable and open to the entire Aragonese territory later (using all the information already accumulated in the Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro), taking the Ebro River as the central axis.


We are looking for the best model for predicting the level of the Ebro as it passes through Zaragoza among the different contestants in the competition. Specifically, the winning model will be the one that makes the most accurate predictions of the river level in Zaragoza. The predictions to be returned by the model are 24, 48 and 72 hours in advance. Here are the details of the challenge
